Graph
- Whatâ€™s the farthest citation?
- Citations to paper of people who have worked with authors divided by people who have not?
- Authors from which field contribute to what other fields?
- Is there a connection between collaborators and where they publish their papers?
- Is there correlation between collaborators and their number of papers? H-index?
- Who of the authors has the biggest network based on collaborators? How far and wide does it go?
- How does the author's previous work help his future work through other authors? Papers of an author that reference a paper that reference the author's previous paper.
